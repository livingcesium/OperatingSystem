Sorry for the caps. I figured I shouldn't send a sketchy zip of some logs, so just run main for a few seconds
and there should be more than enough logging to verify most functionality generated in some folders. They're 
kind of repetetive, but I hope you can parse through them well enough. 

Thank you
